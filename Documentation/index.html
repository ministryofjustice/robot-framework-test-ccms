            The framework has been designed with maintenance in mind. We're using a design pattern called Page Objects. You will find keywords defined in most of these files separated logically. Definition of the different files/folders and files can be found below.

    <h3>Makefile</h3>
    <p>The makefile serves as a single interface for all things contained in this repository regardless of technology used. It is meant to simplify the interface and abstract the complexities of different commands.</p>
    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <p>The entrypoint to the framework calls. The makefile invokes these files using the robot engine. These are the outward facing files that consume all other files (Support/PageObjects) to run the automation needed. We only expect to find Robot files in the tasks folder. They only consume keywords, but do not define them. You will find only 1 task per file, and the name of the file will be the relative to the task name by convention.</p>
    <a href="PageObjects/index.html"><h3>Page Object Keywords</h3></a>
    <p>Page objects represent the different screens that exist within EBS such as login dashboard and universal search. Each screen is individually represented in code as a page object file. This is to reduce cross contamination and keep the related logic of these files isolated to aid in the maintenance. We expect to find screen related keywords in these files. Anything that is created for generic usage should find a home in the Support files. Click on the link above to explore keywords within files.</p>
    <a href="Support/index.html"><h3>Support Keywords</h3></a>
    <p>Support keywords are generic keyword operations that help with more specific tasks. Examples include reading text from any EBS screen or clicking on a non-specific image. Click on the link above to explore keywords within files.</p>
    <h3>Utils</h3>
    <p>Utils are either python or robot files that perform aiding actions for the framework itself. They do not directly aid automation of EBS. Examples are static analysis of the framework and generating documentation. We don't expect to find keywords used in the framework here.</p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>All images used by the framework should be placed in this folder.</p>
